# LDA-TopicModeling

With the enormous amount of data available today, it is important to have a systematic way of grouping them. For the case of text data, grouping can be performed based on the topics of the texts where texts with similar topics are catalogued together. Although reasonable, this approach has a serious practicle limitation: most of the data available today do not have a pre-tagged topic assigned to it. 

One way to overcome this and automatically assign topics to large volumes of unlabelled data is by unsupervised learning.

In this notebook, we will use Latent-Diritchlet-Allocation (LDA), an unsupervised learning algorithm, for clustering similar texts together. LDA assumes that each document is made of several topics and that each topic has a unique probability distribution of words associated with it (words which are common to one topic, say word "pizza" in topic "food", might not be common to some other topic, say "politics"). Given a new document, LDA can assign probabilities for the document to have been generated by each topic.
